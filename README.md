# vocab-app
An Android app to aid foreign language learning.

Often, people may struggle to know what vocab to focus on when starting to learn a new language. Ideally, we want to be able to hold the same natural conversations that we do in our first language. Therefore, I believe a sensible approach for each individual to take is to focus on the vocab that they personally use most frequently.

To gain this personalised data, I wish to be able to record an individual's speech and turn this into a vocab frequency table. This should make it simple for users to identify which vocab they should focus on learning initially.
