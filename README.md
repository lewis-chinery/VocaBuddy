# VocaBuddy

An Android app to aid foreign language learning.

Often, people may struggle to know what vocab to focus on when starting to learn a new language. Ideally, we want to be able to hold the same natural conversations that we do in our first language. Therefore, a sensible approach for a learner to take is to focus on the vocab that they personally use most frequently.

To gain this information, VocaBuddy records an individual's speech and turns this into a vocab frequency table. This clear summary should make it simple for users to identify which vocab they should focus on learning initially.
